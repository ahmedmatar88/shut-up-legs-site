            <h2>The Nathan We Knew</h2>
            <p>
              Whether he was making us laugh, leading adventures abroad, or convincing us to wear Lycra and push for 100-mile rides, Nathan’s spirit was larger than life.
            </p>
            <p>
              He had that rare ability to turn chaos into charm, awkwardness into hilarity, and ordinary moments into legendary stories. He gave his time and energy without hesitation — always putting friendship and fun first.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className={styles.story}>
            <h2>Nathan’s Love for Cycling</h2>
            <p>
              Nathan started a kind of cult in our friendship group… a Lycra-wearing, lasagne-fuelled cycling cult. He was a true pioneer. With his persuasive encouragement and positive reinforcement, he got us hooked — inviting us to weekends in Kendal, testing our limits on Lake District climbs, and insisting we could go “just a little bit further.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He was the only one among us who had the legs, the lungs, and the optimism to push for extra mileage. On one Mallorca ride, we barely made it back after bailing on a final climb. Nathan, disappointed but loyal, led his “weary bunch of dickheads” back to base. He could’ve left us, but he didn’t.
            </p>
            <p>
              He had outrageous confidence on the bike — breaking land-speed records on descents — and even more outrageous optimism. Like the time he promised we’d place top-half in a 200-person Isle of Man race... and we came in the bottom third. Beaten by a one-armed guy.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what mattered most was the magic he brought to every ride. His ability to talk to anyone, to lift the group, and to make cycling more than a sport — he made it a way of connecting, laughing, and living fully. That was Nathan Park.
